## Contributing 

1. Your commits conform to the conventions established [here](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog-angular/blob/master/convention.md)
2. This project used [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) and [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) to handle npm version from CI
    + run git add first to add your changes to staging 
    + use `npm run commit` to commit, and CI will do the rest.
    + if changes contain breaking change, use `BREAKING CHANGE` keyword in the comment to trigger major release
    + before push to git and trigger CI, you can dry run `npm run semantic-release` locally to make sure the version number is push as expected.

## Troubleshooting

1. If you use webpack, check `/demo/webpack`. Try to use the same version of webpack that demo used, if you run into any error.

2. If you don't need AoT support, you can stick with 1.4.0. 2.x is just trying to solve AoT issue.

3. The latest version (2.0.12) should work with AoT, please check /demo/angular2-aot-webpack to see how to make it work.
